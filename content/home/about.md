# Biography

I am a third year PhD student in Statistics at the University of Warwick. I am part of the [OxWaSP](http://www.oxwasp-cdt.ac.uk) programme. I am interested in Applied Statistics, particularly as applied in the Social Sciences. I am currently working on a project analysing data from applications to undergraduate statistics courses in the Statistics department at Warwick, using a decision theory framework. I am supervised by [Dr Julia Brettschneider](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/brettschneider/) and [Dr Anastasia Papavasiliou](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/papavasiliou/). 

I am an R enthusiast. I am the author, along with [Prof David Firth](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/firth/) of the `BradleyTerryScalable` package, which is developed on  [GitHub](https://github.com/EllaKaye/BradleyTerryScalable) and available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BradleyTerryScalable). I am co-organiser of the [Oxford R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Oxford-R-User-Group/) and also an active member of the [Warwick R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Warwick-useRs/) and [R-Ladies London](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-london/).

Prior to the PhD, my academic path has taken me from a BA in Mathematics and Philosophy (University of Oxford), through an MA in History and Philosophy of Science and Technology (University of Toronto), an MPhil in Mathematics Education (University of Cambridge) and an MSc in Applied Statistics (University of Oxford). I also have a PGCE in Secondary Mathematics, have taught at secondary school, and worked in market research.
