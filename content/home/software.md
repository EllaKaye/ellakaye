I am an R enthusiast and enjoy developing packages.

- `BradleyTerryScalable`: An R package to fit the Bradley-Terry model to large and potentially sparse datasets. This package is in the final stages of development. It is currently available on [GitHub](https://github.com/EllaKaye/BradleyTerryScalable), and will hopefully be on CRAN by the end of June. I am very excited to be [talking]({{< ref "talk/2017-03-06-BradleyTerryScalable_useR.md" >}}) about it at [useR!2017](https://user2017.brussels) soon.

- `EMK`: A personal package, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/EllaKaye/EMK), to collect various functions I've written that I find useful in a number of settings (admittedly, currently just one function!).
