I am an R enthusiast and enjoy developing packages.

- `BradleyTerryScalable`: An R package to fit the Bradley-Terry model to large and potentially sparse datasets. The package is developed on [GitHub](https://github.com/EllaKaye/BradleyTerryScalable) and available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=BradleyTerryScalable). The development documentation is available [here](https://ellakaye.github.io/BradleyTerryScalable/reference/index.html). 

- `EMK`: A personal package, available on [GitHub](https://github.com/EllaKaye/EMK), to collect various functions I've written that I find useful in a number of settings.
